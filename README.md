# Container With Most Water

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the **Container With Most Water** problem.

## Problem Description

Given an array `height` of non-negative integers, where each element represents the height of a vertical line drawn at that index, the goal is to find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container holds the most water.

You may not slant the container.
